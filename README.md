# CS601_TermProject: Personal Portfolio Website

Hello Professor,

I'm happy to share my term project with you - it's a personal website that shows my professional journey. On this website, you'll find information about my career, the places I've worked, the projects I've done, and how my cultural background has influenced my work.

Please take a look at the website to get a better idea of my experiences.

Best,
Fehmi
